My name is Ruby Lalli and I am a Data Engineer :)

Here you'll find a collection of some of my past and present projects, ranging from landing pages to more robust scripts on scheduling and webscraping logic.

Each project is hosted on Github and you can browse the source code, documentation, and other project resources directly on the project pages. I hope that you find these projects useful and inspiring, and I invite you to delve into them in more detail.. 🙌

If you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me directly through https://linkedin.com/rubjit-lalli 

Thank you for visiting and happy coding!" 👨‍💻💻😎
